## General Info and Motivation

This project was created to document my current reading list in a visual and intuitive way. The project was implemented using objects and object constructors with the goal of minimizing code in the global scope.

## How to Use

- Access the library app [here](https://andreww-00.github.io/Library/)!
- To add a new book, simply click the "New Book" button in the top right corner of the screen.
  - A form will appear, asking for the title, author, page number, and whether the book has already been read.
  - Clicking "Submit" will add the book to the "Shelf" section of the website.
- Clicking the "X" button on a card will remove it from the shelf.
- Clicking the "Read" button will toggle the read status of the book.

## What I Learned

- The importance of writing reusable code, which helped encapsulate variables within their respective functions, away from the global scope.
- How to effectively use objects and object constructors to store and create complex items.

## Improvements

- Address sizing issues that cause the screen to be larger than its maximum size.
- Implement the ability to close the form by clicking outside of it.
- Enhance mobile-friendliness of the site.
- Add form validation using JavaScript.
